07/11/2019, 16:27  || others || Jacinda Ardern || A pretty historic moment - today we pass our Zero Carbon legislation into law. Tried to summarise what it means for New Zealand...||
28/11/2019, 23:03  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Forty years ago today 257 people lost their lives in a tragedy that we commonly refer to as “Erebus.” I’ll struggle to summarise the words from today’s commemoration, so instead I’ll post the link to the full apology that too many people waited too long for. https://www.beehive.govt.nz/…/prime-minster-delivers-erebus…||
27/11/2019, 17:57  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Mixed emotions today as we opened the new Suicide Prevention Office. There’s so much support for the work to end suicide in New Zealand - people like Nehe Milner-Skudder who is working in mental health and well-being with @headfirstnz. All of us want a country where an office like this isn’t needed, till then I’m grateful for all the people working to make that world possible (like Sir Mason Durie who has kindly agreed to chair our Maori Advisory Board and keep sharing all his wisdom.)||
21/11/2019, 17:04  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Despite coming from a police family (my dad was in the police for 40 years) I’ve never been to a graduation. But today the 1800th police officer graduated since we took office. So impressed with the diversity, skills and qualifications in the wing we saw - the top graduate had a background in mental health. A very proud day (and in case you missed it, I’m the one who’s not in blue...)||

16/11/2019, 14:33  || others || Jacinda Ardern || This year was the second year in a row that I've asked for a little bit help to design my Christmas card. Once again, I was absolutely overwhelmed by all the creative and wonderful artwork we received. To all the children and young people who sent something in - thank you so much! I loved every single one of them. I ended up choosing four different designs - you can see them all in the video below.||

30/10/2019, 20:43  || others || Jacinda Ardern || A very blurry shot of me being very excited to hand over the Prime Minister’s Excellence Award for Vocational Education at Western Springs College. For the first time this award is being handed out in secondary schools and kura across the country to raise the profile of vocational education and taking up opportunities like apprenticeships...and it comes with $2,000 to help with future learning (or costs like tools for those who go into the trades.) Couldn’t imagine handing it over to a better recipient than Ihaka, who plans to become a builder, loves rugby league, and helps coach primary kids. All of that should explain the blurry smiles!||
30/10/2019, 18:10  || others || Jacinda Ardern || It’s one thing to design something on paper when you’re in government, it’s another to be able to see it in action. The roll out of nurses in secondary schools is something I absolutely believe in - and I’m proud that we’re now reaching so many young people and supporting their physical health, but especially their mental well being. Thanks Rosehill College for showing me the difference this programme is making!||
28/10/2019, 23:05  || others || Jacinda Ardern || In 2015 some young people from Otorohanga College learnt the history of the New Zealand wars, and rightly decided it was a period in our history that should be better acknowledged. And now that is beginning to happen. Te P24/10/2019, 10:22  || others || Jacinda Ardern was live. || Here with Minister James Shaw to talk about our latest climate change announcements!||

A real pleasure to open it officially this morning, and to also visit the Cawthron institute to see the great work they’re doing on innovative projects like the use of seaweed to help reduce our agricultural emissions. Hope the sun shines on you all for the rest of the day in sunny Nelson, and if you’re lucky enough to be visiting I hope you see the light show in the town centre as part of the Nelson Arts Festival - it’s amazing!||

Visited the Air force team out at Whenuapai today, including an amazing group of young people who were part of the LSV (Limited Service Volunteer) programme, but I only managed to remember to take a pic as we were leaving. Special thanks to the young people who joined LSV via work and income who shared their stories with me. It may only be a 6 week course but as one young man said to me “I was a bit lost, this helped me find my accelerator”||

These units will provide shelter for 120 families a year. I’m standing next to Sister Mary Foy who has been helping to provide emergency housing in NZ for more than 30 years - a true treasure.||

Thanks to the Otago Daily Times for inviting me to the Class Act awards to celebrate your amazing students, and to Spout Alternatives for the introduction to your brilliant initiative to reduce waste at cafes by having milk supplied in kegs instead of plastic bottles.

This week is volunteer week and a chance to say thank you (my small version of that was spreading a little cupcake love to the wonderful people who bake weekly for groups like neonatal units, women’s refuge and those who are without homes.) Not sure I can claim it to be my baking when I cooked it, but it came from a box mix. But it’s the thought that counts, right?||

19/05/2019, 20:51  || others || Jacinda Ardern || We said one of the things we wanted to do this budget was break the cycle of family violence in New Zealand. Today we started with the biggest single investment to address family and sexual violence made in a budget, ever. It will mean we finally start trying to prevent harm, make sure victims have the support they need, and better coordinate the work we do as a government. Jan Logie has done a huge amount of work on this one (thanks Jan!) supported by all the team. Now we start.||
17/05/2019, 14:38  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Leaving France and trying to think of how to summarise the last few days. Ultimately, the ‘Christchurch Call’ to action was all about trying to prevent violent extremism and terrorism online, and ensure what happened in New Zealand to our muslim community never happens again. Along with France, we brought countries and tech companies together for the first time and had them commit to doing things differently. This is a first step, but a really important one. (Pictures cover meetings with civil society, tech companies, the summit itself, and bilateral meetings with the King of Jordan, and the Prime Ministers of Canada and the UK)||

13/05/2019, 11:37  || others || Jacinda Ardern || In the wake of the 15th of March, we learned what happened in Christchurch was unprecedented - it was a terrorist attack that was designed to go viral and do harm in so many ways. No New Zealander should have seen the terror attacks livestreamed on social media. That's why we're taking New Zealand's story to Paris, where we will rally tech companies and world leaders around the Christchurch Call. We know social media platforms are global - that means the way we eliminate violent extremist content online needs to be global too. Hear more about why it's so important we act:||
12/05/2019, 20:35  || others || Jacinda Ardern || For Mother’s Day we all got together for a pre Budget announcement! Today we announced that we’re extending Housing First by an extra 1000 places. Housing First doesn’t just house people, it breaks the cycle of chronic homelessness by providing support with whatever other needs someone may have like mental health or drug and alcohol issues. With the extra investment we’re putting in this budget, Housing First will have now have a total of 2700 places across Auckland, Rotorua, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch, Northland, Nelson, Tauranga and Hawke’s Bay. This is exactly the kind of thing a well being budget is all about. Happy Mother’s Day again! And thanks for having us Vision West.||
12/05/2019, 09:17  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Just when you thought you couldn’t be any more grateful for your mum than you already are, you have your own child and your appreciation for your own mum keeps growing with every day that passes. Happy Mother’s Day to all the mums, mums of mums, mums being mums by themselves, and all those who play mum for those who need one. I feel incredibly grateful to those who help me be a mother, but I’m especially grateful for my own.||
11/05/2019, 19:03  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Deeply saddened to hear that Sir Hekenukumai Busby has passed away. Sir Hek was a master of waka building and celestial navigation. It was my honour to be at the investiture for Sir Hek at Waitangi earlier this year. I will never forget the passion and love on display for him. He gave so much to the next generation and in turn, they honoured him. I wish you well on your final journey Sir Hek. May the waters be calm and the stars guide the way to your final resting place.||
09/05/2019, 11:05  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Feels fitting that the day after announcing our new Zero Carbon Bill we’re here, in Taranaki at the Just Transitions Summit, planning the pathway to our low emissions future. We just announced that a National New Energy Development Centre will be created here to lead the development of new clean energy technologies. We have a long way to go, but we’re starting.||
08/05/2019, 18:59  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Today we introduced the Zero Carbon Bill into parliament. It’s been a long time in the making, but we’ve worked really hard to build as much consensus as we can around the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We know climate change is happening, we can see it. This bill is the start of our journey as a country to do everything we can to limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees. Thanks to all those who got us here, especially Hon James Shaw.||

This is what he had to say "I stayed awake quite a lot of the night. I didn't sleep too well ever since. I thought it was so sad. You can feel the suffering of other people..... I think it's such a tragedy, and yet it has the other side. It has brought people together, no matter what their race or anything. People suddenly realised we're all one. We care for each other." Thank you John. Your actions warmed the hearts of so many during a time of such sadness.||

Today we finally announced the design for a memorial, one which was chosen by a panel that importantly included representatives of the families, and which will be completed next year. It’s been a long time coming but it’s been a privilege to be a small part of it.||

These include services for mothers and babies, as well as child, adolescent and family inpatient services and adults with high and complex needs. A huge thanks to the wonderful staff working in mental health, especially those who helped ...      See more||

26/02/2019, 15:36  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Spent the afternoon meeting some of the Oranga Tamariki team and then finished here, with Lifewise, talking about the work they do to support young people once they leave care. There are some wonderful examples out there (like the supported housing Lifewise offer to give real life flatting experiences) we just need more of it! And a big thank you to Minister Tracey Martin for the work she is doing on this, and who was off doing an interview when we got our sneaky group photo!||

22/02/2019, 12:51  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Thinking of everyone in Christchurch today as we mark 8 years since the earthquake that took so much from so many. I often hear people talk about their lives literally being in two parts now - life before and life after the quakes. We have many responsibilities as governments when it comes to disasters and rebuilds, but one is that we must always keep an eye on the past while we try to build hope for the future.||
21/02/2019, 17:46  || others || Jacinda Ardern || If you’re in Wellington over the next few days, make sure you go to Te Matatini ki te Ao at Westpac Stadium. It’s the most incredible event and only happens every two years. I was lucky enough to see Te Iti Kahurangi perform an oriori they wrote for Neve Te Aroha. Thank you - it was beautiful!||

16/02/2019, 16:43  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Been a bit useless with the old frequency of posts these past few days! Headed back to Nelson on Thursday to check in with the fire and civil defence team, and visited one of the schools that has been temporarily relocated (you can see all the kids waving goodbye as we left - they were definitely making the best of a really tough time.) Popped into the Lantern Festival yesterday and also headed to Napier for their Art Deco celebrations, complete with a visit on one of our Navy vessels. We’ve had some fairly sizeable announcements this week too, like vocational training. Will try and do a quick FB live tomorrow with an update on all of that though.... till then!||

It’s also very, very cold!||
22/01/2019, 08:30  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Met with PM Theresa May this afternoon to discuss trade and Brexit amongst other things.

Repairs were needed at more than 750 sites to get the train running again, but an amazing team of workers made it happen. It was a treat to be there for the first journey and to announce that with funding from the Provincial Growth Fund we’ll turn this into an all year round service, increase capacity, upgrade stations and bring more visitors through this beautiful part of the world.||
21/11/2018, 20:30  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Not the most exciting of images, but it tells a story. You might remember some of the discussion about Counties Manukau DHB and the infrastructure challenges there. This is the exterior of the hospital, and it’s one of many kinds of things that will be fixed with the $80mill we pledged to them today. In the meantime, a huge thanks to the incredible team who work inside these walls, and do an amazing job.||

Thanks for all the laughs you two, with a special thanks to Laura Daniel. You made me laugh at myself in a very literal way!||
15/11/2018, 21:45  || others || Jacinda Ardern || If you’ve been reading about the East Asia Summit, this is what it looks like. Quite a bit of discussion on regional security, environmental challenges, and trade. Will make sure I do a Facebook live before I leave Singapore to share a few more details!||
10/11/2018, 16:32  || others || Jacinda Ardern || It’s been a busy week and I have been rubbish at posting updates about it! In amongst it all we had the Labour conference, Ratana’s 100th commemorations, a visit to Whakatane where the Mayor gifted me a painting of the area near where I used to live, and the launch of Te Tai - treaty settlement stories. The common theme in amongst it all? Some brilliant young people!||
05/11/2018, 12:43  || others || Jacinda Ardern || You might remember that a few weeks ago, I asked for a little bit of help to design the front of my Christmas card.

I couldn't choose just one so we're going to have a couple of different cards. You can see them all in the video below.||

13/10/2018, 14:50  || others || Jacinda Ardern || This is Jo. You might have read about her in the paper this morning. Jo had a baby around the same time as I did, but after her baby arrived she found out that her leukaemia was back. I know Jo, and I also know that it’s going to take finding a donor to help her get well. And this is the bit where we can make a difference to her, but potentially to lots of other people too. Here’s how. Go out and give blood, and when you do, ask to be added to the bone marrow donor registry. Because of a whole range of complexities, I’m told that if you’re a man with ancestry other than European, you’re most likely to be added to the list because that’s where the greatest need is. So please, spread the word. You could help save a life.||

Thanks @krisfaafoi for your work to put a cap on the amount of interest and fees that can be charged on high cost loans. It will stop families being taken advantage of and from falling into a debt spiral. It’s the right thing to do, and it’s been a long time coming!||

Some of the potential efficiency savings are huge, but so are the risks if we don’t invest in such important assets. This announcement also came with the added excuse to see the new friends I made here a couple of months ago, and to say thanks!||

They were buried thousands of miles away but today in an incredibly moving service, they were finally returned to their loved ones.

15/08/2018, 22:40  || others || Jacinda Ardern || I was sitting in a meeting as I saw a stream of teachers reach the steps of parliament today. They were there to send us a message, so I went down to hear it. Yes we have issues to resolve, but I absolutely believe we can do that together.||
10/08/2018, 18:05  || others || Jacinda Ardern || After a big push from the public, and some huge changes by business and retailers, today we announced that we will be phasing out single use plastic bags in NZ. Big thanks to Minister Eugeine Sage and the @nzgreenparty for all the work on this one, and to every young person who wrote to me about it. Every letter counted!||

09/08/2018, 11:36  || others || Jacinda Ardern || It was seven years ago (from opposition) that we first talked about supporting more young people into work and training by giving the equivalent of the dole to an employer who provides them with work, a wage, and training. Today we made it a reality!||
09/08/2018, 11:16  || others || Jacinda Ardern was live. || Just finished launching Mana in Mahi- Strength in Work...here are a few details!||

01/08/2018, 10:06  || others || Jacinda Ardern || A year ago today I became the leader of the Labour Party. Two things stand out - how fast a year can feel even when a huge amount changes, and just how lucky I am. I have the privilege of working alongside amazing people everyday. So to them- thank you and see you soon!||
29/07/2018, 14:20  || others || Jacinda Ardern was live. || A quick hello as we get ready to come back!||

23/06/2018, 21:36  || others || Jacinda Ardern || So saddened to hear of the passing of Koro W22/06/2018, 15:26  || others || Jacinda Ardern || One of the many special people we have been so grateful for over these past few months, our wonderful midwife Libby. Not only is she incredible at what she does, this morning she made me macaroni and cheese because she heard me mention a wee craving yesterday. Thank you so much for everything Libby!||
21/06/2018, 18:14  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Welcome to our village wee one. Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb) Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We're all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital.||
18/06/2018, 17:53  || others || Jacinda Ardern || No more flying means teleconferences, a lot of phone calls, and a Monday visit to the electorate office to catch up on a few bits and pieces. If you haven’t met them before, this is Therese and Barbara and they are exceptional human beings. I feel very lucky to have them in our Mt Albert office! #PMfromSandringham #waiting||
16/06/2018, 20:47  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Even though this is the usual weekend bag of reading and papers, I never get tired of the section dedicated to children’s letters that have arrived that week. Total highlight!||
16/06/2018, 08:03  || others || Jacinda Ardern || The end of a busy week and somehow I missed mentioning three highlights. First was announcing that we’re supporting the Auckland City Mission with more than $16 million in funding to build a new housing facility that will have dedicated detox beds (30 of them...Auckland currently only has 20 in total!) The second was announcing that we’re making sure all employees in the core public service will at least earn the 2018 living wage. And the last one? Seeing my niece! Have a great weekend everyone!||
14/06/2018, 17:57  || others || Jacinda Ardern || The @fieldaysnz have changed a bit since I went as a kid growing up in Morrinsville! Thanks to everyone who looked after us today. My highlight - seeing the focus on innovation and the next generation!||
13/06/2018, 19:18  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Thank you so much to the Morrinsville Knitting Circle (the Morrinsville Knitter Knatters!) for the amazing hand made blanket! Such a lovely surprise to arrive home to. Next stop, @fieldaysnz||
12/06/2018, 18:03  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Our Minister for Civil Defence just sent me these images from Gisborne, and last night @whaitirimeka sent me through reports of what she was seeing and hearing on the ground. The local Civil Defence team have been doing a huge job and after last night it just got bigger. We’ve declared a medium scale event given the damage around Tolaga Bay especially, and that will help us get practical assistance to where it’s needed. In the meantime, thinking of everyone who has been impacted by this one.||
12/06/2018, 15:30  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Introducing our new Chief Science Advisor, Professor Juliet Gerrard! Professor Gerrard is a biochemist, the Associate Dean of Research at Auckland Uni and used to chair the Marsden Fund amongst many other things. In the short time I’ve been PM I’ve formed a huge appreciation for the network of science advisors Sir Peter Gluckman has created (thanks for your work Sir Peter!) and I know it will only continue to go from strength to strength under Prof Gerrard. Looking forward to working with you and the team, Juliet!||
08/06/2018, 17:07  || others || Jacinda Ardern || If you’re looking for some mid morning motivation, I highly recommend spending an hour with a few entrepreneurs and start ups, listening to their ideas and successes. So heartening that every single one is working on things that will/are having a positive impact on our communities. Thanks @cocoscantina for organising and hosting!||
07/06/2018, 15:27  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Quick visit today with Shanan, our candidate for the Northcote By-election. If you live that way and haven’t voted yet, you have till Saturday evening!||
07/06/2018, 08:46  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Meant to post this last week when I was given a few surprise gifts from the team on the AM show, including this from Mark Richardson. Well played Mark, well played.||

04/06/2018, 07:29  || others || Jacinda Ardern || “The rebel’s got their medals.” Loved hearing the Topp Twins talking this morning about becoming Dames and that accepting the award was “the most political thing we have ever done. All the protests have been worth it. The nuclear free issues, the Springboks, the Homosexual Law Reform... it’s an honour to say we told the truth and we were right.”||
01/06/2018, 12:21  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Day up North starting with Whangarei where we announced more social and state housing, work on safety and transport improvements, and $10mill to help deliver the Huntertwasser Arts Centre and Wairau Maori Art Gallery. Just the construction period alone will create 60 jobs and once it’s done, it will attract as many as 200,000 visitors and $26million in economic benefits to the area. Win win! Now off to Kaikohe...||
31/05/2018, 14:14  || others || Jacinda Ardern || Visit to Newton Central School, the opening of the new playground at Learning at the Point Kindergarten in Pt Chev and a community morning tea - all made for a wonderful day!||
30/05/2018, 19:04  || others || Jacinda Ardern || A little closer to home today! Out campaigning with @shananhalbert our candidate for the Northcote by-election and a visit to Western Springs College and their massive redevelopment!||
