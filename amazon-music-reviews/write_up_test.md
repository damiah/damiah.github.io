### Motivation

To understand at a high level how 'embeddings' work, how to apply deep learning methods from the ground up, and stumble to the finish line with something useful and interesting.

### Inspiration

After following Jeremy Howard's fantastic fast.ai collaborative filtering lessons, I wanted to produce a recommender using PyTorch (what the fast.ai library is built atop of). I thought it would be cool to see if I could build a low-fi music recommender.

### Final output(s)
Our model learns weights for each album in vector space in such a way that it optimises our loss (error) during classification. Below is how each album looks after dimensionality reduction using PCA.
