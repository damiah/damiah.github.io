10/11/2019, 08:30 || others || Paula Bennett || 22,000 more people on the dole since National left office. There's clearly no plan to get people in to work. It's just not fair on hard working, tax paying Kiwis! || 
08/11/2019, 18:03 || others || Paula Bennett || Outrageous Fortune was a cultural phenomenon that had Kiwis across the nation proudly 'reclaiming their inner Bogan.' I've always been a proud Westie and the show played a part in making it okay to be a Westie. Happy birthday NZ On Air! Here's to another 30 years!. || 
08/11/2019, 10:10 || others || Paula Bennett || Ridiculous comment from a Labour MP. This is the kind of thinking from Labour that sees welfare dependency skyrocket whenever they’re elected. Being on the dole shouldn’t be a long-term lifestyle choice. Insulting to our hardworking farmers and exporters. ||

01/11/2019, 08:00 || others || Paula Bennett || New Zealand has one of the worst rates of child abuse in the developed world. Police respond to one incidence of family violence every seven minutes. National will invest further to extend the ISR initiative to more communities, to further reduce family violence. ||

18/10/2019, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || An increase in gang membership means an increase in crime in our communities and more victims. You can't trust Labour on law and order. ||

Visited Canopy Growth who grow and manufacture cannabis for both medicinal and recreational use. That is a bag of about 50 joints (that can’t be sold like that to individuals). The regulations are stringent. I was quite taken back in Vancouver at how much marijuana I could smell in the streets. Also found time to observe the elections and get out and about with a couple of conservative candidates || 
07/10/2019, 15:42 || others || Paula Bennett || The Government's soft on crime approach has led to a 26% increase in gang membership. Gangs do nothing but peddle misery, are disrespectful and violent to women and create victims. National is the party of law and order. We will release a comprehensive Gang Plan in 2020 that will crack down hard on gangs. || 
03/10/2019, 09:23 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour is trying to convince Kiwis that its failure to deliver in health is National's fault. That's not true. National made record investments in health during our #9YearsOfProgress. ||

11/09/2019, 17:10 || others || Paula Bennett || The resignation today of Nigel Haworth cannot be, in the Prime Minister's words, "the PR quick fix—usher the source of the controversy away." Yes, Mr Haworth needed to go, and it should have happened weeks ago, but what is also known is that the Prime Minister's own senior staff and a senior Minister have known the seriousness of the allegations but have not acted. ||

04/09/2019, 15:09 || others || Paula Bennett || This Government has failed to fully inform New Zelanders on the negative outcomes of legalisation, and what a 'yes' vote would actually look like because they don't know. Canada legalised less than 12 months ago. We should delay the referendum and wait for the evidence from Canada to come though. ||

16/08/2019, 18:00 || others || Paula Bennett || This is great news given the range of harmful effects that marijuana use can have on the developing brain, and it’s great to see such positive steps being taken by our young people. However, the data does raise the question of why we are looking to make a harmful drug more readily available when we have evidence of declining use. https://www.tvnz.co.nz/…/cannabis-use-among-kiwi-high-schoo… || 
15/08/2019, 13:49 || others || Paula Bennett || In 2017, 44% of New Zealander's voted for National to govern our great country. Instead, we have a Government that is failing to deliver on its promises. I am thrilled to head into the 2020 General Election as National's Campaign Chair. This a massive commitment and one I want to give 100% of myself to, as such I won’t be seeking re-election as the MP for Upper Harbour but will be on the National Party’s List. We can’t afford another three years of this tax and spend Government, National is ready, organised and has the best team to lead this country! ||

22/07/2019, 10:26 || others || Paula Bennett || Alongside the Government’s plan to tax higher-emissions vehicles it is also proposing a vehicle emissions target, meaning importers will be charged a penalty on vehicles that don’t come in under the target from 2025. That could slap an extra $4500 onto the import cost of an average new car and an extra $2250 onto the cost of an average used car – costs that will almost certainly be passed on to buyers. The actual cost of Julie Anne Genter’s car tax on Kiwis could be more than $6000 per vehicle, which is a bit more than the “small fee” she keeps talking about. || 
18/07/2019, 18:00 || others || Paula Bennett || Increases in drugged driving affect us all, and this Government needs to be doing more to help keep us safe on the road. || 
18/07/2019, 17:18 || others || Paula Bennett || Here’s an updated list of all the new taxes this Government is imposing on Kiwis. Labour’s Car Tax is just the latest cash grab New Zealanders can’t afford - from a Government they can’t afford. || 
17/07/2019, 18:00 || others || Paula Bennett || Kiwis can't trust this Government on Tax. Not content with the latest fuel tax, this Government is committed to telling hard-working kiwis what cars they should be driving. Have a look at the tables below to see which vehicles will be affected by Labour's Car Tax. || 
17/07/2019, 13:39 || others || Paula Bennett || The Government is telling Kiwis their new Car Tax is just a 'small fee.' But it's equivalent to more than two months of groceries. How out of touch can you get? New Zealanders can't afford this Government. || 
17/07/2019, 11:25 || others || Paula Bennett || Here's more on how Labour's Car Tax could affect road safety. If you're buying a safer car, you'll pay the Car Tax to subsidise unsafe cars. The Government also doesn’t seem to realise many of the cars they want to force Kiwis into driving with their Car Tax may be banned by the time the scheme comes into effect. || 
16/07/2019, 18:32 || others || Paula Bennett || Great day yesterday in Whanganui Waverley and Hawera with Harete Hipango. Met some amazing people working for their community, held a few meetings with businesses and the public and called into retail (it was work - honest!) || 
15/07/2019, 17:30 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour's Car Tax will slap thousands of dollars in tax on some of New Zealand's most popular cars. But the Minister reckons it's just a "small fee." Will Kiwis agree it's just a "small fee," Minister? || 
15/07/2019, 13:50 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour's Car Tax is penalising New Zealanders and affects us all, especially the farmers and tradies who simply can't get by with a suzuki swift. National is about standing up for hard-working kiwis against another tax they cannot afford. From a Government they cannot afford. || 
15/07/2019, 10:27 || others || Paula Bennett || I found this article really interesting. I have real concerns for our farmers and the survival of some rural communities if careful consideration isn't given to what planting 1 billion trees actually means.

10/07/2019, 10:52 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour's Car Tax will hit New Zealanders everywhere. If you're buying a Toyota Hiace, you'll be slapped with an extra $1400 fee, or up to $2000 for some of New Zealand's most popular small family cars like the Mazda CX-5 or the Hyundai Tucson. This Government is about more taxes and higher costs of living, with no relief in sight. || 
09/07/2019, 18:00 || others || Paula Bennett || In 2012 National started the alcohol and other drug treatment courts to help break the cycle of drug-based offending. They have been a proven success. Now, this Government has put current funding on hold and backtracked on rolling the programme out nationwide. ||

07/03/2019, 14:32 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour’s Tax Working Group has proposed that farmers will pay a Capital Gains Tax of more than $600,000 for an average dairy, sheep or beef farm if they sell it ten years’ time. What’s worse is the Tax Working Group has also proposed a whole series of unnecessary environmental taxes that will cost thousands more. This is a tax grab, plain and simple. || 
04/03/2019, 12:14 || others || Paula Bennett || No one likes a whinger and they like a politician trying to garner sympathy even less. But last week's opinion piece by Jay Kuten has motivated me to respond. ||

01/03/2019, 11:59 || others || Paula Bennett || Labour’s Tax Working Group proposes taking more of what you earn. Part of the tax grab includes your retirement savings. We’ve worked out that the average KiwiSaver member would have $64,000 less for their retirement.... that’s a whole year of wages for the average worker. ||

14/02/2019, 17:37 || others || Paula Bennett || May come as a surprise to some, but I was disappointed to see the Police continuing to spend resources on aerial cannabis operations. Not only does it threaten the supply of medicinal cannabis to the most vulnerable, but also drives up the price for recreational use – often turning people to more harmful stuff like meth. || 
12/02/2019, 11:58 || others || Paula Bennett || Really looking forward to starting a weekly political panel on Breakfast tomorrow. Just a shame there won’t be anyone from Labour there. C’mon Kelvin Davis Grant Robertson Phil Twyford Chris Hipkins MP Andrew Little Megan Woods - MP for Wigram... whatever happened to open and transparent? ||

06/02/2019, 20:07 || others || Paula Bennett || Here’s the latest offering at Hobsonville Point in my electorate. Little Creatures offers outstanding food and drinks, is right by the ferry and even has an awesome play area for the kids. That’s Rupert the manager who employs around 100 people at hobby. The queues were long to get in today at their official opening but I’m sure you will walk in any other day straight away as it’s the largest bar in New Zealand (or so I’m told). ||

21/01/2019, 11:16 || others || Paula Bennett || It makes no sense that with unemployment so low and with jobs for the taking there's literally over 10,000 more people on the Jobseeker benefit than this time last year. The Government's gone soft. There's absolutely no reason why we should give up on the expectation that people put serious effort into finding a job. (Credit: 1 NEWS) ||

05/12/2018, 17:42 || others || Paula Bennett || We will stand here day after day and ask questions on behalf of New Zealanders on serious matters that the Prime Minister can duck and can dive and can avoid and can just use a lot of words but not actually say anything—virtue signaling and making everyone try and feel better without actually answering the questions that the public deserves. Day after day they've been asked and they have not been answered. || 
04/12/2018, 08:11 || others || Paula Bennett || It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 30/11/2018, 13:58 || others || Paula Bennett || Great day so far at Palmerston North. Really interesting meetings and engagement with great people. Thanks Adrienne Pierce !!! ||

Fees-free has cost taxpayers $2.8billion and it hasn't performed. The Minister needs to admit that his flagship policy is a failure and redirect the billions of dollars to where it’s actually needed. ||

05/09/2018, 21:11 || others || Paula Bennett || Didn't plan on standing up here and starting my general debate speech like this, but actually, the fact that Clare Curran so poorly answered her question and with such obvious discomfort, one has to simply call it out for what it is. || 
04/09/2018, 18:47 || others || Paula Bennett || Another notch on Employment Minister Willie Jackson's belt where he has gotten his facts wrong AGAIN! This time in the house during question time. Like I said, platitudes don't work, getting your facts right and hard work does. || 
04/09/2018, 14:00 || others || Paula Bennett || It’s day one in the house and I’m ready to hold this Government to account! || 
03/09/2018, 16:48 || others || Paula Bennett || Employment Minister Willie Jackson is wrong of almost every stat he cites in this interview.

03/09/2018, 12:19 || others || Paula Bennett || Had a great meeting today with young women from my local high schools of Massey, Glenfield and Hobsonville point.

28/08/2018, 10:35 || others || Paula Bennett || This Government continues to outsource its job to working groups and reviews - it's now commissioned over 150 of them - that's one every two days. What's more it's costing at least $170 million and that's with a third of them still to be costed. That's money that should have been invested in areas like health and education. ||

09/08/2018, 12:08 || others || Paula Bennett || Freedom of speech, tolerance of dissent, and respect for democracy are core Kiwi values worth fighting for and these values are under threat. #WATCH as Simon Bridges explains how every single legal expert submitted against the so-called Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Bill, and the Greens say it goes against their principles and policies, so why are they allowing themselves to be pushed around over it? We believe voters should be the only ones to be able to dismiss MPs and that's in an election. ||

21/05/2018, 17:35 || others || Paula Bennett || This Ardern-Peters Government is putting the squeeze on middle New Zealand and making it harder for people to get ahead. Their new taxes and bad spending – on everything from creating more than 100 working groups to prioritising diplomats over doctors – is ramping up costs and taking more money out of the back pockets of hardworking New Zealanders. Let’s also not forget the Government cancelled National's Family Incomes Package which would have ensured workers on the average wage were able to keep more than $1000 of their own money every year. The Government says it knows better how to spend that money but its track record and priorities prove otherwise. ||

12/04/2018, 16:21 || others || Paula Bennett || I just feel gutted that the Ardern-Peters Government has today blindsided regions and industry with its decision to ban gas and petroleum exploration.

29/06/2017, 11:22 || others || Paula Bennett || Tourism spend grew in every region in the year to May. Encouraging to see places like the West Coast (up 14%), Tasman (up 11%) and Northland (up 10%) reap the benefits of continued strong tourism growth. || 
28/06/2017, 18:58 || others || Paula Bennett is in Honiara, Solomon Islands. || It's great to be in the Solomon Islands to mark the end of the Regional Assistance Mission.

Mary Bennett (no relation) is one of the locals who's been trained up to serve on the local police force. || 
28/06/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || One of our strong focuses is on how do we attract more high value tourists - getting them to stay longer, spend more, and see more of New Zealand. The new $100m infrastructure fund will also go a long way to meeting the challenge of strong tourism growth. || 
27/06/2017, 11:12 || others || Paula Bennett || I've just announced the members of the new Tourism Infrastructure Fund panel - a really good combination of people across the sector and across the country.

01/06/2017, 13:38 || others || Paula Bennett || We’ve listened to the concerns of shop keepers, that’s why we’ve put aside $1.8m to be used for co-funding for a range of security and prevention measures. https://beehive.govt.nz/r…/funding-prevent-violent-robberies || 
01/06/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || Amazing - are you one of the 550 or so people who walked the length of New Zealand on the Te Araroa this summer? ||

26/05/2017, 18:01 || others || Paula Bennett || Not all superheroes wear capes- some wear hi-vis vests! It was impressive to visit the NZ Post International Mail Centre in Auckland and see the work Customs do to stop drugs at our borders. || 
26/05/2017, 14:41 || others || Paula Bennett || Latest report shows Greenhouse gas emissions steady since 2003 and falling in 2015. Also shows emissions intensity of the economy decreased by 35.9%, indicating the economy is becoming more carbon efficient. It's good signs and there's more to do which is why we need to continue the Government's work programme on climate change. || 
26/05/2017, 13:25 || others || Paula Bennett ||  ||

20/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || An example of the neat cards Tourism NZ put together for the visit of 10,000 Amway sellers to Queenstown staggered over Autumn.

14/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || This is kind of genius - electric rubbish trucks that could be powered by the waste they collect! || 
13/05/2017, 11:33 || others || Paula Bennett || I'm so proud of our New Zealand Police || 
13/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || This is pleasing to see - Tourism New Zealand has a strategy of getting more visitors to visit off-peak in the "shoulder seasons" (Autumn and Spring) to smooth out demand periods. || 
12/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || Another way of diversifying what New Zealand has to offer to our visitors. || 
11/05/2017, 17:54 || others || Paula Bennett || Fourth chair on The Project NZ tonight making my presenting debut - hope they like my "Mum jokes"! ||

11/05/2017, 11:13 || others || Paula Bennett || I've just announced a big $178m boost for tourism infrastructure alongside Maggie Barry MP. Tourism is hugely important to New Zealand. It creates jobs and brings in billions of dollars to the economy. That’s why it’s important that we keep investing so we continue to attract high-value tourists and give them an amazing visitor experience. #NZBudget2017 || 
11/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || More than $6 million was poured into Southland's economy as a result of the 2017 World Shearing and Woolhandling Championships. Our champion PM beating legend Sir David Fagan? Priceless! ||

09/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || Wing 303 was the first attestation (Police graduation) that I attended so it's cool to see recruits ready to get stuck in and do the tough job of keeping us safe. || 
08/05/2017, 20:55 || others || Paula Bennett || Today I released figures which show the highest ever percentage of women on state sector boards and committees. There’s still more work to be done in the state sector but this is a real milestone. We need to continue to encourage and support women into leadership roles. I encourage all New Zealand organisations to strive for greater diversity in their workforce and leadership. || 
08/05/2017, 16:51 || others || Paula Bennett || Remember it's just a small, but very important, scratch! ||

06/05/2017, 12:36 || others || Paula Bennett || Fabulous day in Auckland yesterday with Graeme Sinclair filming for Gone Fishin' around Karepiro Bay. It really is a family production - wife Sandy backed the boat in, son James drove and pup Mickie kept us on our toes back on land. I'm worried Graeme's "man cave" is going to give hubby some grand designs though.. || 
06/05/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || I was so pleased to see Mark Mitchell MP's promotion into Cabinet last week, as a former police dog handler he knows exactly how hard out officers on the front line work. ||

This is the equivalent to a journey from Cape Reinga to Bluff, and back to the steps of Parliament. Farmers aren't the problem - they're the solution! ||

My bloke didn't believe we had a possum so I bought this trap on trade me, it instantly kills them. Can't believe how big and healthy he was!!! Predator free in my yard one possum at a time..... ||

24/04/2017, 09:11 || others || Paula Bennett || Tourism Industry Aotearoa - TIA and 100% Pure New Zealand's fourth Mood of the Nation survey showed some interesting things you won't hear in the opinion columns - 96% of us agree tourism is good for NZ; half of us think we're attracting the right number; and a quarter actually think we need more. With 188,000 jobs and billions into the economy, I think it's doing just fine. ||

21/04/2017, 09:00 || others || Paula Bennett || This is neat - Airbnb's "Trips" allows users to create their own genuine experiences for other users with the aim of bringing together "where you stay, what you do and the people you meet all in one place". Another good use of technology to get the most of NZ tourism. || 
20/04/2017, 23:22 || others || Paula Bennett || 20/04/2017, 16:03 || others || Paula Bennett || Lowest since 1997. 1997. That's fewer kids dependent on benefits, and more families with stable jobs, incomes and opportunities. For so many it is long term and life changing. ||
