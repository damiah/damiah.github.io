02/02/2017, 12:42  || others || Kelvin Davis || The P-koi has marched through Kaitaia. This is not just a Maori problem, it's an everyone problem. It's not just a Tai Tokerau problem, it's an everywhere problem. Hopefully other communities and regions will get proactive and support those they know, and don't know to get off this crap.||

The kaikorero from the other side spoke about the issues facing Maori and as it happens were key Labour issues, housing, health, poverty and hunger, incarceration etc, so it was great that Andrew Little had solutions. The minor parties had a crack at each other - Gareth Morgan at Winston Peters and vice versa. Was too busy to remember to take photos until too late.||

21/01/2017, 10:25  || others || Kelvin Davis || This year's hikoi from Cape Reinga to Waitangi to coincide with Waitangi Day Commemorations is to raise awareness around 'P' / meth in our communities. This isn't just a Maori problem or a Far North problem. It is a people problem that affects all communities in New Zealand, all ethnicities, the rich and the poor. We're struggling to get people behind the cause, for whatever reason - fear maybe, embarrassment maybe, apathy maybe. ...     See more||

20/01/2017, 20:48  || others || Kelvin Davis || This afternoon I visited the road block out at Omauri/ Pipiwai that has been established because the locals have had enough of the dust which is a real health issue. It is horrible to breathe in and its gets all through their houses. The vehicles and logging trucks in particular stir the dust up in the summer. They have been on to the various Councils' cases for 4 years and the logging is set to go on for about another 6 years. The Councils have some empathy from me because they just don't get the funding from Central Government as back country roads aren't a priority despite the fact the logging contributes to the economy. The situation certainly wouldn't be tolerated in any township. It's not fair or right that the health of the residents along these roads is compromised.||
20/01/2017, 20:48  || others || Kelvin Davis || The scene at the Omauri/ Pipiwai roadblock. The Council members didn't turn up but will apparently be there on Tuesday to discuss a proposal from Whangarei District Council.||

Which is a bit dumb and is a disincentive for people to take rubbish to the dump if they know the council will eventually pick it up for free anyway. Secondly while most of t... See more||
