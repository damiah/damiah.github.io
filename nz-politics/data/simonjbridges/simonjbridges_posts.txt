26/11/2019, 08:28  || others || Simon Bridges || Gang numbers are up 26% under Labour and Kiwis are sick of escalating violence and intimidation in our towns and cities. We're proposing a unit to target, interrupt and harass gangs, modelled on NSW's Strike Force Raptor. We're going to take back control.||

24/11/2019, 19:46  || others || Simon Bridges || Working prisons were introduced by National to get prisoners doing something productive. It's currently an opt-in system. National is proposing that it becomes compulsory. Working prisons provide people with the skills and opportunities they need so they're able to become contributing members of society. It's currently estimated that around 59% of prisoners participate in in employment or industry training. This helps in achieving better reintegration into the community when... See more||

15/11/2019, 14:14  || others || Simon Bridges || Education is a great leveller which allows us to overcome the circumstances into which a child is born. It will also skill up and make New Zealand more productive and strong, allowing us to do so much, from building more roads and houses to solving scientific problems and understanding ourselves better. I think about it all the time for my own three young children, Emlyn, Harry and Jemima, and I know all parents do.||

Part of that is making sure there is accountability in our welfare system. Most New Zealanders agree being on the dole shouldn't be a long-term lifestyle choice. I sat down with Newshub Nation to talk about it.||
02/11/2019, 07:15  || others || Simon Bridges || Last time National was in government, we moved thousands off the dole and into work. Under Labour, 22,000 more Kiwis are on the dole. This week, I launched our Social Services Discussion Document, which is packed full of plans to help Kiwis live better lives. I am aspirational for New Zealanders and, in Government, National will get this country back on track. Read our Discussion Document here: https://www.national.org.nz/social_services||

For those of you who don’t know my story, my beautiful wife Natalie and I have been married for 14 years. She’s phenomenal.

Today I launched National's Social Services Discussion Document, as part of the biggest policy development process by an Opposition ever. The current Government has no plan to grow the economy and is failing to deliver for New Zealanders. We’re doing the work now in Opposition so we’re ready to hit the ground running in 2020.||

This is what the PM said when she made her light rail promise to Kiwis: “Under Labour we are going to build light rail from our CBD to our airport. But I’m not just committed to that, I’m committed to starting straight away… We don’t just believe it, we’ll do it.” Like KiwiBuild, 1800 new police, immigration and health commitments, light rail is just another promise Labour has failed to deliver on....

Gangs do nothing but peddle misery and create victims and they've grown by 26% under Labour. As a Crown Prosecutor, I saw first-hand the damage they do to New Zealand. I don't buy into their spin. My Government will crack down hard on gangs.||
16/10/2019, 11:59  || others || Simon Bridges || Gang numbers are up in my region under Labour. Our communities shouldn't be overrun by gangs peddling violence and misery.

It’s frustrating to watch what this Government is doing, or not doing around infrastructure. It’s not just physically slowing us down, it’s slowing down the entire economy. Today's dismal business confidence numbers show exactly that.

24/09/2019, 12:25  || others || Simon Bridges || Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin needs to immediately explain how a convicted paedophile has been allowed to be involved in meetings at the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in State Care. As a father and a former Crown Prosecutor, I find it unconscionable that a paedophile was allowed anywhere near this Royal Commission. Tracey Martin needs to be upfront about when she was made aware of this and what action she took. When she found out, she should have ensured immediately that he had absolutely no further connection with this inquiry.||

27/07/2019, 16:20  || others || Simon Bridges || A fantastic National Party Conference this weekend. We’re focused on building a New Zealand that helps Kiwis get ahead. Our bottom line is you.||
27/07/2019, 12:42  || others || Simon Bridges || ||
27/07/2019, 12:29  || others || Simon Bridges || Our bottom line: You.||
27/07/2019, 12:09  || others || Simon Bridges || Love catching up with our hardworking party members at the National Party Conference.||

26/07/2019, 18:45  || others || Simon Bridges || Someone’s ready for the National conference...||
24/07/2019, 10:00  || others || Simon Bridges || I'm holding the Government to account on their taxes. They want to hold me to account on my accent. Doesn't bother me. I'll keep pointing out Labour's high taxes and how they're making it harder and harder for Kiwis to get ahead. As a priority, my Government will link tax brackets to the cost of living so you keep more of your own money.||
23/07/2019, 23:05  || others || Simon Bridges || Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming Prime Minister of the UK. Boris is a great friend of New Zealand.||
22/07/2019, 10:04  || others || Simon Bridges || Amazing work from our Silver Ferns. We are all so incredibly proud of you for bringing it home.||
21/07/2019, 09:48  || others || Simon Bridges || The Government is sending a clear message to New Zealanders, do as we say, but not as we do. Rather than slapping a Car Tax on hardworking Kiwis who can’t afford it, the Government should get their own house in order when it comes to EVs.||
19/07/2019, 18:40  || others || Simon Bridges || Speaking at Jonathan Young’s seniors morning tea this morning in New Plymouth. Like me with my kids, they told me they want a New Zealand where their grandkids stick around to build lives and careers here, instead of moving overseas. With a weakening economy, more taxes and higher costs under this Government, young Kiwis are choosing to move away. We can’t afford a Government that makes our best and brightest want to leave.||
19/07/2019, 15:30  || others || Simon Bridges || When I said Labour’s Car Tax would slap up to $3000 on Kiwis buying cars, I was wrong. It’s actually higher. Another hidden cost in the Government’s plans could hit the average new car with an extra $4500 in tax. A Holden Colorado could cost up to $6350 more under Labour’s Car Tax. Will Julie Anne Genter keep calling it a ‘small fee’ or will she finally acknowledge this is just another tax grab New Zealanders can’t afford.||
19/07/2019, 11:46  || others || Simon Bridges || Fantastic morning in New Plymouth with Jonathan Young. Spun the prize wheel on The Hits and spoke to hundreds of Taranaki locals at meetings around town. After an oil and gas ban, stalled roading projects and more taxes being piled on, Taranaki hasn’t had a fair go from this Government. Taranaki locals are resilient and know how to get on with the job but this Government is making it harder and harder. It’s becoming clearer that New Zealanders can’t afford this Government.||
18/07/2019, 17:30  || others || Simon Bridges || 14 years of marriage with my wonderful wife Natalie today. Here’s a picture from our wedding day. Three kids and lots of happy memories since then.||
18/07/2019, 14:39  || others || Simon Bridges || Loved getting around AUT Re-O Week today meeting young Kiwis.||
17/07/2019, 17:45  || others || Simon Bridges || Visiting Alltech in Henderson today with Chris Penk to learn about their work on reducing methane from cows. Our farmers are the most efficient food producers in the world and introducing agriculture into the Emissions Trading Scheme before the tools are available to address emissions will simply be a new tax on the sector and will hurt New Zealand. National has always been a strong supporter of technology not taxation.||
17/07/2019, 16:05  || others || Simon Bridges || Selfie time after a Caucus meeting with National's Youth MPs yesterday.||
17/07/2019, 12:50  || others || Simon Bridges || Out in Helensville today with Chris Penk and saw this. This morning the Government announced a plan that’ll see speed limits cut to 80km/h. But they won’t invest in new roads. If the Government is serious about wanting to save lives then it will reverse its policy of not investing in new roads, act on drugged drivers and put more money into road safety policing which saw a cut in the last Budget....

16/07/2019, 17:15  || others || Simon Bridges || Great to welcome my Youth MP Ben Sokimi to Wellington today for Youth Parliament. A wonderful opportunity for young people across New Zealand to get an insight into how Parliament works.||
16/07/2019, 14:54  || others || Simon Bridges || Talking to media this afternoon about Labour’s Car Tax. With cost of living up and Kiwis struggling to get ahead, the last thing New Zealand needs is another tax. New Zealanders can’t afford this Government.||
15/07/2019, 17:30  || others || Simon Bridges || Labour's Car Tax will slap thousands in tax on some of New Zealand's most popular cars. They're trying to sell the policy to Kiwis by saying it'll be revenue-neutral. But it looks like it'll actually be a massive tax grab. Just another tax Kiwis can't afford, from a Government they can't afford.||
15/07/2019, 10:01  || others || Simon Bridges || ||
14/07/2019, 08:46  || others || Simon Bridges || Figures out this morning show the Minister in charge of Labour's Car Tax has mislead Kiwis in saying the plan is revenue-neutral. Even if Labour's Car Tax doubles the number of efficient cars on our roads, the Government will pocket almost half a billion dollars in extra taxes. New Zealanders simply can't afford this Government. Kiwis can’t trust this Government on tax. They couldn't get their Capital Gains Tax past the public, so now they're trying to sell new taxes to New Zealanders by dressing them up as 'small fees' - as Julie Anne Genter likes to say.||
12/07/2019, 18:05  || others || Simon Bridges || Another fuel tax increase last week and now a new Car Tax from the Government that'll hit Kiwis who can least afford it. But they're still not investing in new roads. Where's it all going?||
11/07/2019, 16:30  || others || Simon Bridges || How good is ScoMo! Fantastic to catch up with PM Scott Morrison (ScoMo) today in Sydney. The relationship between our two countries is strong and means more than ever. I took the opportunity to congratulate him on passing his tax relief package last week that’ll see ordinary Australians keeping more of what they earn.... See more||
10/07/2019, 13:47  || others || Simon Bridges || When I was Transport Minister, I worked hard to get more electric vehicles onto New Zealand roads. But that never involved an unfair Car Tax that would hit hardworking Kiwis. Have a look at these tables to see which cars will get hit by Labour's Car Tax.||
09/07/2019, 18:01  || others || Simon Bridges || This morning the Government proposed ANOTHER tax on hardworking Kiwis. This time, they’ll make you pay more for your car. A Mazda CX-5 for example will be slapped with an extra $1500. With more fuel tax added last week, rents up $50 a week and the cost of living rising, it’s clear New Zealanders can’t afford this Government.||
08/07/2019, 17:27  || others || Simon Bridges || Hardworking New Zealanders are struggling to get ahead under this Government. Whether it's the latest fuel tax increase, rents being up $50 a week or rising electricity prices hitting families, it's clear that Kiwis can't afford this Government. Earlier this year, I announced what we'll do to make sure you keep more of what you earn. A National Government will link income tax brackets to inflation as a priority, ensuring income taxes are adjusted every three years in line wit... See more||
06/07/2019, 07:50  || others || Simon Bridges || Heading into the Budget lockup in May with my now Finance Spokesperson Paul Goldsmith. Unlike this Government, my team and I have a plan to help Kiwis get ahead. We understand a strong economy is what pays for health, education and infrastructure.||
04/07/2019, 14:43  || others || Simon Bridges || ||
02/07/2019, 18:05  || others || Simon Bridges || Every week I meet hardworking Kiwis at small businesses across New Zealand. They need a Government that backs them to get ahead and grow under their own steam. Right now they don't have that. Stats out today show business confidence is at a 10 year low under this Government - the worst it's been since the depths of the Global Financial Crisis. That means small business owners are less likely to invest in new equipment or take on more staff.... See more||
01/07/2019, 18:00  || others || Simon Bridges || Today's fuel tax increase is another blow to Kiwis struggling with the high cost of living under this Government. National understands New Zealanders can't afford this Government. That's why we'll move to link tax brackets to inflation in our first term. That means you'll keep more of what you earn and won't be hit with tax increases by stealth.||
01/07/2019, 12:20  || others || Simon Bridges || 4 cents more a litre in fuel taxes but no new roads? Labour's hitting Kiwis with higher costs at the pump and failing to deliver the roads New Zealanders desperately need. You can't trust Labour on transport.||
30/06/2019, 08:16  || others || Simon Bridges || The last thing Kiwis need is another tax increase. New Zealanders can’t afford this Government.||
26/06/2019, 17:30  || others || Simon Bridges || Kiwi households will be hit by an extra $7000 in taxes over the next four years because of this Government. New Zealanders can't afford this Government.||
25/06/2019, 16:28  || others || Simon Bridges || This morning my friend and colleague Amy Adams MP told caucus she’ll be standing down at the 2020 election. Amy and I were elected to Parliament at the same time and worked together on the Justice and Finance portfolios as ministers. She’s been wonderful to work with and should be proud of the contribution she’s made in improving the lives of New Zealanders. Amy is a close friend, a brilliant woman and I wish her nothing but the best in whatever comes next.||
22/06/2019, 11:08  || others || Simon Bridges || Great to open the Bay of Plenty round of Apprentice of the Year this morning. It’ll be guys like these who’ll lose out if the Government’s polytech reforms go ahead. I’ll be fighting for our apprentices against Labour’s gutting of regional education.||
20/06/2019, 09:39  || others || Simon Bridges || In the Hutt this morning with Chris Bishop. Last year, Phil Twyford said the Melling Interchange ticks all the boxes but now they’re not going to look at funding it for another 10 years. Labour is failing to deliver on transport. Today I committed to National starting Melling in our first term. We’ll get on with the job.||
19/06/2019, 18:30  || others || Simon Bridges || Labour is failing to deliver on the economy. I asked the PM today what GDP growth per person is under her Government and she didn’t know. The fact is it’s down from 1.6% under National to 0.6% under Labour.... See more||

13/05/2019, 18:44  || others || Simon Bridges || This Government is taking New Zealanders for a ride when it comes to KiwiBuild. They announced the policy seven years ago but they still haven't figured out how to deliver it. Another case of over-promising and under-delivering.||
13/05/2019, 10:04  || others || Simon Bridges || I'm bloody angry at the Government's inaction on drug driving.

08/05/2019, 20:04  || others || Simon Bridges || Labour's been trying to sell KiwiBuild to Kiwis for seven years. Seven years to figure out how it'll work and they still can't figure out how to deliver it. The broken promises are stacking up.||

29/04/2019, 12:35  || others || Simon Bridges || When we've got doctors striking and cancer drugs in need of funding, is spending $1.1 million on slushies in prisons really the best use of taxpayer money from this Government? Credit: Breakfast||
28/04/2019, 09:49  || others || Simon Bridges || #SlushyFund So the Government's just spent 18 months trying to convince Kiwis that making them pay more tax is a great thing. But now we uncover a Government department under Labour spending $1.1 million on slushies. This kind of wasteful spending shows they clearly don’t know how to spend what they’re already taking.||
26/04/2019, 16:21  || others || Simon Bridges || This Government may like vague talking points about wellbeing and kindness but they don't have plans or policies. National does. On Breakfast earlier this week talking about the Government's Capital Gains Tax debacle.||

17/04/2019, 22:42  || others || Simon Bridges || So the Government has wasted 18 months and $2 million on a Tax Working Group to suggest a Capital Gains Tax. While they've been doing that, investment has completely slowed down as business owners worry what the future will look like. This has made Kiwis worse off.||
17/04/2019, 15:58  || others || Simon Bridges || After 18 months of waiting and a $2 million Tax Working Group, our relentless opposition to a Capital Gains Tax has forced the Government into an embarrassing backdown. Unlike them, we’ve got a plan when it comes to the economy. No new taxes in our first term and we’ll index tax brackets to inflation. National believes Kiwis deserve to keep more of what they earn.||

Our strength as a nation is our compassion and our welcoming of diversity. It has been a hallmark of our culture for hundreds of years. This will not change us. Because at times like these we do not consider ourselves Christian or Muslim, Sikh or Jew. Or Maori or Pakeha, Chinese, Pacific Islander, Indian or any other ethnicity.... See more||

What’s worse is the Tax Working Group has also proposed a whole series of unnecessary environmental taxes that will cost thousands more. This is a tax grab, plain and simple.||

30/08/2018, 15:05  || others || Simon Bridges || Business confidence is in free fall. Not only is confidence down, but hiring, investment and export intentions are all down. Companies have real concerns about this Government's anti-growth policies. More working groups is not the solution. Good economic policies that promote growth are, and that's what National would provide.||
29/08/2018, 15:22  || others || Simon Bridges || Fuel prices are at an all time high of $2.39 a litre vs $1.59 in Aussie. The main reason for the difference is tax, and this Government is piling more and more on, hurting Kiwi families all over the country. National will repeal the regional fuel tax and reduce that burden.||
29/08/2018, 12:37  || others || Simon Bridges || Small businesses are the engine room of the economy. This Government's anti-growth policies are having a real impact on them. They need a clear economic plan to help them get ahead, which National will provide.||
28/08/2018, 11:25  || others || Simon Bridges || The Prime Minister's answer to plummeting business confidence: set up another working group. Once again it's all slideshows and slogans and nothing of a plan to actually drive our economy forward and give the certainty that businesses require.||
26/08/2018, 18:55  || others || Simon Bridges || This Government continues to outsource its job to working groups and reviews - it's now commissioned over 150 of them - that's one every two days. What's more it's costing at least $170 million and that's with a third of them still to be costed. That's money that should have been invested in areas like health and education.||

13/07/2018, 12:18  || others || Simon Bridges || The extra borrowing needed to fund this Government’s loose and untargeted spending will saddle taxpayers with an extra $1.6 billion in interest costs over the next four years.

This Government has slashed it to $158m. Tauranga has been a loser under this Government in terms of infrastructure investment, getting less from the Housing Infrastructure Fund and seeing the cancellation of the four-lane Tauranga Northern Link from Tauranga to Katikati.

As a parent myself, I can't imagine what those boys and their families have been through. It was a heroic effort by all involved - wishing them all a speedy recovery.||

09/07/2018, 09:04  || others || Simon Bridges || This Government’s borrow, tax and spend attitude means they will be increasing public debt by $17 billion – that’s the equivalent of the cost the National-led Government faced to rebuild after the Canterbury earthquakes.||

03/07/2018, 15:31  || others || Simon Bridges || Off the back of falling business confidence under this Government, I often get asked what would National do differently. We would lay down a strong platform for economic growth, with good policies, investing in better infrastructure, providing certainty and by getting out of the way of businesses.||

01/07/2018, 13:07  || others || Simon Bridges || This regional fuel tax is simply punishing Aucklanders for the Government and the Council’s lack of fiscal discipline. A re-elected National Party will overturn it.||

29/06/2018, 14:30  || others || Simon Bridges || One of the major issues in Hawke’s Bay is this Government axing the extension of the Napier-Hastings Expressway, like so many major regional roading projects, in spite of increasing taxes - all to fund a tram in Auckland.||

26/06/2018, 15:33  || others || Simon Bridges || Just nine months ago, this Government gave a "rock solid guarantee” there would be no national strikes. Yet here we are facing a nationwide nurses' strike next week.||
26/06/2018, 13:16  || others || Simon Bridges || There's been more strikes initiated in the past 9 months than in 9 years under National. This Government has got themselves in this situation by raising expectations pre-election and now not delivering. Labour's union-driven employment law reforms will only make this worse and lead to more strike action.||
25/06/2018, 18:17  || others || Simon Bridges || And the strike action is escalating.||

19/06/2018, 14:20  || others || Simon Bridges || More strikes, falling business confidence, fewer jobs being created and more cost pressures on Kiwi households - it's clear New Zealand is stalling under this Ardern-Peters Government.||
18/06/2018, 19:35  || others || Simon Bridges || ADD YOUR VOICE: In just a few days, Aucklanders will be paying up to $15 more to fill up their cars when the regional fuel tax comes into effect. But motorists in Tauranga and all across the country could also soon be paying 11.5c a litre more for their fuel with this new tax. That's going to hit Kiwis hard in their back pockets. SIGN OUR PETITION: www.stopthefueltax.co.nz||
18/06/2018, 17:30  || others || Simon Bridges || It's National Volunteer Week so today I popped in to say thanks to all of the volunteers at SPCA Tauranga. They do a great job caring for neglected and abandoned animals. I'd also like to say a massive thank you to all of those who give their time and skills to volunteer across New Zealand. #NVW2018||
18/06/2018, 15:24  || others || Simon Bridges || The first priority of a Government should be keeping New Zealanders safe, and I stand on the side of having fewer victims in these areas. Building more prison beds means fewer victims, which in turn means better rehabilitation and reintegration for our offenders.||
17/06/2018, 20:52  || others || Simon Bridges || This year's Fieldays was another huge success. A fantastic showcase of our primary sector and the world-leading innovation in New Zealand. Congratulations to all involved, especially Peter Nation and his team and all of the volunteers and exhibitors.||

15/06/2018, 10:37  || others || Simon Bridges || This morning in a speech at Fieldays I outlined how National plans to take the politics out of climate change and work with other political parties to create an independent climate change commission. Climate change is one of the world’s most serious environmental challenges - National want practical, science-based solutions that won’t harm our economy or drive up the costs of living for New Zealanders. When I became Leader of the National Party, I promised to focus more on the environment and I remain committed to that.||

13/06/2018, 19:42  || others || Simon Bridges || It was great to be back where I turned sod on the Taramakau Bridge, part of our Accelerated Regional Roading Package when we were in Government. These were priority projects around the country we invested in to improve productivity and help people get around their communities.||
13/06/2018, 15:59  || others || Simon Bridges || This Government doesn't prioritise the safety of New Zealanders. It will only be providing 600 more prison beds, far less than what’s needed to ensure violent criminals aren’t out causing havoc in our communities. National had plans to build a new 1500-bed prison because we're committed to doing what's required to keep New Zealanders safe.||
